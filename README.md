<!-- ## Hi there 👋 -->

## Welcome! 👋

Hi, I’m Alison Huang, a data analyst and developer currently based in California. My interests include data analysis, web development, machine learning, game design, and communication research.

In 2024, I earned my M.S. in Communication Data Science from the University of Southern California, and in 2022, I earned a B.A. in Communication with a minor in Web Development from the University of Southern California.

I specialize in the intersection of data analysis and digital communication strategies. One of my recent projects focused on developing a machine learning solution using Steam and Twitch data to predict game popularity on Twitch.

Currently, I am a UI/Backend software engineer at Easley-Dunn Productions.
